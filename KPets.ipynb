    "King County's Lost, Found, and Adoptable Pets: An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short exploration of the open dataset provided by King County titled, \"Lost, found, adoptable pets\". I picked this data because I have a parrot, and the facebook groups I'm in frequently make posts about lost birds. This led me to wonder if there was an open dataset for lost animals. A simple google search led me to King County's open dataset repository, where I found the pet section (https://data.kingcounty.gov)\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with the data is to look at whether or not there is a difference in the proportions of dogs and cats that are considered \"adoptable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I wanted to gain an understanding of the type of data found within the dataset, so I looked at the beginning and end of the data"
