My name is Stryker and I am available for adoption.  I weigh 55 pounds.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on 02/16/22 because they were moving into a home that doesn't allow dogs. I lived in a home with 2 kids ages 15 and 5 years old. My previous owner described me as a strong personality and protective of my people. I am not a fan of fireworks and don't like having my collar grabbed. <p/><p/>I am practicing how to ""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", and ""down"".<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>I cannot live with cats or other small animals.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

I need to live in a home without any young children.<p/><p/>I will need to find a home where someone is available for me in these early days. It is important to be consistent with me and socialize me so I can have the best companionship with people and other animals. I require patience because everything is brand new so I will need some TLC while I learn. The shelter is unsure if I am crate training yet and teaching me those skills will help tremendously on a road to success! If you and your family are ready to fall in love my awesome self, please check me out!!<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

I was brought back on 2/17/22 due to frequently escaping from my fenced yard. <p/><p/>I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing! I would do best in a home with older children. <p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! At the shelter I am practicing how to ""sit"".<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs or prey animals. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or I may need a very slow introduction to other dogs.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",BLUE

My name is Pixie Cat and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on March 28, 2022 because they were possibly facing homelessness. <p/><p/>I must admit I am a bit shy initially, but being here at RASKC is just very to new to me. Just give me a couple minutes to warm up to you and I will be begging for affection!<p/><p/>Although I may be 12 years old, I have a lot of life and love still in me to give! Due to my age I may be sensitive to handling so please look for signs that I may need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)   Hyperthyroid<p/><p/>This animal has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism; excess production of thyroid hormone.  Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, vocalization, increased urine production and heart disease.  This condition is being managed with daily medication.  Other treatment options may be available, including radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Periodic blood testing to monitor thyroid levels is needed.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.  An educational handout is provided.<p/><p/>2)    Feline oral resorptive lesions<p/><p/>Feline oral resorptive lesions (FORLs) usually appear as a red raised area of gum tissue alongside the tooth where the crown meets the gum line, but can also be occurring under the gum line.  To adequately and thoroughly diagnose which stage a tooth may be in requires probing and dental radiographs (x-rays).  This condition is progressive and resorption of the tooth continues until no recognizable tooth structure remains.  These lesions are very sensitive when touched, and may even cause some cats to drool or be hesitant to eat or chew.  At this time, this cat is comfortable and eating normally, however evaluation by your veterinarian is needed.  Many times tooth extraction is the only treatment possible.<p/><p/>Additional care for these conditions may be needed after adoption. Please follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>",BLUE
